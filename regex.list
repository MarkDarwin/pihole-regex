# Installation
# If you have made it directly to this list and are wondering how to apply these to your Pi-hole
# installation, there is a Python (3.6+) script to automate this process. Please see:
# https://github.com/MarkDarwin/pihole-regex

# N.B - False Positives
# Due to the restrictive nature of these regexps, you may encounter a small number of false positives
# for domain names that are similar to ad-serving / tracking domains.
# I will continue to update the following whitelist with any conflicts, and you can choose to
# add them to your install if you so wish, or use them as a reference.
